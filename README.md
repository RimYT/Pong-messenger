# 🌐 Pong! – Self-Hosted Secure Messenger

Pong! is a simple self-hosted messenger that focuses on privacy and control over your data. The project uses open technologies, supports encryption, and can run on any server you manage.

# 💾 Fully Self-Hosted

Can be deployed on any server you control.

Works without relying on centralized services.

Hard to block, since all infrastructure belongs to the user.

Each user has their own public/private key pair.

Messages are encrypted with the recipient’s public key and decrypted only on their device.

Intercepted traffic does not reveal message contents.
